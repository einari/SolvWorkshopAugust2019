# Sample of Dolittle from the ground up

Documentation for Dolittle can be found [here](https://dolittle.io).
Presentation can be found [here](https://1drv.ms/p/s!AhD7O7za4wxGgcV7820oWophkxSpJA).

## Fundamentals

This project highlights a couple of the features found in Dolittle Fundamentals,
helping you adhere to the SOLID principles and build that easier can apply Separation
of Concerns and also making your solution lean more towards convention over configuration.

## Application

The application consists of 2 microservices; MyBC1 and MyBC2. They are configured as follows:

**MyBC1**

Backend: http://localhost:5000
Frontend: http://localhost:8080

**MyBC2**

Backend: http://localhost:5001
Frontend: http://localhost:8081

### MongoDB

For the read models, you will be needing a Mongo, the easiest way through Docker is to run
it as a daemon for your self:

```shell
$ docker run -d -p 27017:27017 mongo
```

### EventStore

Events are stored in the EventStore, this needs to be running. Run it through Docker:

```shell
$ docker run -d -p 2113:2113 -p 1113:1113 eventstore/eventstore
```

Go [here](https://eventstore.org) to read more about EventStore.

#### Admin UI

EventStore has an Admin UI that you'll find here:

URL: http://localhost:2113
Username: admin
Password: changeit

### Starting the Microservices

Run them accordingly using multiple shell windows:

- `dotnet run` in the `Core` folder of both - this will run the backends
- `yarn` / `npm install` in the `Web` folder
- `yarn start` / `npm start` in the `Web` folder

### Event Horizon and events between microservices

In **MyBC2** there is a second event project called `Events.MyBC1`.
This holds the events **MyBC2** is interested in from **MyBC1**.
Notice that the event is tagged with an attribute of `Artifact` with
the identifier of the event found in `artifacts.json` in **MyBC1**
inside the `.dolittle` folder of the `Core` project.
This same identifier is also configured in the `event-horizons.json`
file of **MyBC2** in the `.dolittle` folder of the `Core` project there.
There is an `EventProcessor` in **MyBC2** that consumes this event and
prints out a message.
